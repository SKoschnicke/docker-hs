# Contributing

If you wish to contribute please see [any issue on GitHub tagged with "help
wanted"](https://github.com/denibertovic/docker-hs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).
Before starting to work, consider commenting on the issue you want to resolve or
open a new issue to discuss design decisions and implementation details. This is
so that no development cycles go to waste on implementing a feature that might
not get merged either because of implementation details or other reasons.

Make sure to submit your PR's against the `master` branch.
